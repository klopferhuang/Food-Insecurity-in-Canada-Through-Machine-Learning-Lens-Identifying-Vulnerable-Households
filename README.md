# Food Insecurity in Canada Through Machine Learning Lens: Identifying Vulnerable Households

## Introduction

This research tackles predicting household food insecurity in Canada using machine learning tech- niques. Specifically, we leveraged ensemble methods and regularisation to predict food insecurity using the Canadian Income Survey (CIS) 2018 dataset. The most effective model was the Reg- ularised Random Forest, which outperformed others in recall rate and test accuracy. Notably, this model demonstrated consistency and reliability when applied to the 2019 CIS data. 

Feature importance measures revealed key factors influencing food insecurity, such as the age of the oldest household member, provincial tax credits, and education level of the primary earner. The studyâ€™s findings provide a foundation for policy prioritisation and decision-making, emphasizing the poten- tial of machine learning in predicting food insecurity and informing effective interventions in the context of developed countries such as Canada.
